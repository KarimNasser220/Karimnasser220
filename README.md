Hi everyone, I am a computer science undergrad (not special) and I just started learning Github. I hope my time using Github is pleasant 
I'm okay with coding, not in love with it yet but I can see the potential relashionship I can have with coding if I learned it well
I like sports, mostly football
I also like living healthy, and having an impressive physique
